    <p>Avian carriers can provide high delay, low
        throughput, and low altitude service.  The
        connection topology is limited to a single
        point-to-point path for each carrier, used with
        standard carriers, but many carriers can be used
        without significant interference with each other,
        outside of early spring.  This is because of the 3D
        ether space available to the carriers, in contrast
        to the 1D ether used by IEEE802.3.  The carriers
        have an intrinsic collision avoidance system, which
        increases availability.</p>
